\title{Read an 'info.txt' file}
\usage{
ReadInfo(
  filename = "info.txt",
  encoding = c("unknown", "UTF-8", "latin1"),
  mode = c("simple", "exact"),
  comment.duplicates = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Path to and file name of the info.txt file to import.}

\item{encoding}{Character string, encoding of non-ascii characters in imported text file. Particularly relevant when
importing files created under Windows (default encoding "Latin-1") in Linux (default encoding "UTF-8") and vice versa. See
also argument description in \code{\link{scan}}.}

\item{mode}{Use \code{simple} to read info.txt file as a nested list to that provides easy access to key information.
Alternatively, use \code{exact} to read info.txt file as a list matching the exact info.txt file structure (including all comment lines).}

\item{comment.duplicates}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, then duplicate codes will be commented out when reading the input file. If \code{FALSE},
then the input file will not not be checked for duplicate codes.}
}
\value{
\code{ReadInfo} returns a named list. List names are settings codes
(see \href{http://hype.smhi.net//wiki/doku.php?id=start:hype_file_reference:info.txt}{info.txt documentation}). Settings with two
codes are placed in nested lists, e.g. \code{myinfo$basinoutput$variable}. Multi-line subbasin definitions for basin outputs and class
outputs are merged to single vectors on import.
}
\description{
Import a HYPE model settings information file as list into R.
}
\details{
Using \code{ReadInfo} with the \code{simple} mode discards all comments of the imported file (comment rows and in-line comments). The function's purpose is to quickly
provide access to settings and details of a model run, not to mirror the exact info.txt file structure into an R data object. If you would like to mirror the exact file
structure, then use the \code{exact} mode.
