\title{Re-scale SLC classes in a GeoData data frame}
\usage{
RescaleSLCClasses(gd, slc.exclude = NULL, target = 1, plot.box = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gd}{A data frame containing columns 'SLC_n' (\eqn{n \ge 1}), typically an imported 'GeoData.txt' file.}

\item{slc.exclude}{Integer, SLC class numbers. Area fractions of classes listed here are kept fixed
during re-scaling. If \code{NULL} (default), all classes are re-scaled.}

\item{target}{Numeric, target sum for SLC class fractions in each subbasin after re-scaling. Either a single
number or a vector with one value for each row in \code{gd}.}

\item{plot.box}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, a box plot of SLC area sums is returned.}
}
\value{
\code{RescaleSLCClasses} returns the data frame provided in \code{gd}, with re-scaled SLC class fractions.
}
\description{
\code{RescaleSLCClasses} re-scales several or all SLC classes for each SUBID in a GeoData data frame
to a new target sum for all classes.
}
\details{
\code{RescaleSLCClasses} allows to rescale SLC classes, e.g. as part of a post-processing work flow during
HYPE model setup. Individual SLC classes can be excluded to protect. This can be useful e.g. for lake areas which
maybe must correspond to areas a LakeData file. The function will throw a warning if excluded SLC class fractions
are greater than sums provided in \code{target}, but not if they are smaller.

\examples{
# Import source data
te <- ReadGeoData(filename = system.file("demo_model", "GeoData.txt", package = "HYPEtools"))
# Re-scale SLC classes, protect the first two
RescaleSLCClasses(gd = te, slc.exclude = 1:2)
