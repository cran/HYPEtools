\title{Calculate upstream sums and averages of selected GeoData contents}
\usage{
UpstreamGeoData(
  subid = NULL,
  gd,
  bd = NULL,
  olake.slc = NULL,
  bd.weight = FALSE,
  signif.digits = 5,
  progbar = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{subid}{Integer vector of SUBIDs for which to calculate upstream properties (must exist in \code{gd}).
If \code{NULL} (default), upstream areas for all SUBIDs will be calculated.}

\item{gd}{A data frame containing a column with SUBIDs and a column with areas, e.g. an imported 'GeoData.txt' file.}

\item{bd}{A data frame with bifurcation connections, e.g. an imported 'BranchData.txt' file. Optional argument.}

\item{olake.slc}{Integer,SLC class number which represents outlet lake fractions. Mandatory for weighted averaging of outlet lake depths.}

\item{bd.weight}{Logical, if set to \code{TRUE}, flow weights will be applied for areas upstream of stream bifurcations. See
\code{\link{AllUpstreamSubids}} for further details on flow fraction computation.}

\item{signif.digits}{Integer, number of significant digits to round upstream variables to. See also \code{\link{signif}}.
Set to \code{NULL} to prevent rounding.}

\item{progbar}{Logical, display a progress bar while calculating SLC class fractions. Adds overhead to calculation time but useful
when \code{subid} is \code{NULL} or contains many SUBIDs.}
}
\value{
\code{UpstreamGeoData} returns a data frame with the same number of columns as argument \code{gd} and number of rows corresponding to number of
SUBIDs in argument \code{subid}, with updated upstream columns marked with a leading 'UP_' in the column names.
}
\description{
Function to calculate upstream sums and averages for selected variables of imported GeoData.txt files.
}
\details{
\code{UpstreamGeoData} calculates upstream averages or sums of selected variables in a GeoData data frame, including branch connections
in case of stream bifurcations but not including potential irrigation links or groundwater flows. Averages are weighted by sub-catchment area, with
the exception of outlet lake depths and rural household emission concentrations provided in GeoData variables 'lake_depth', 'loc_tn',
and 'loc_tp'. Outlet lake depths are weighted by outlet lake area and the GeoData column with
SLC class fractions for outlet lakes must be provided in function argument \code{col.olake.slc}. Rural household emissions are weighted by
emission volume as provided in column 'loc_vol'. Elevation and slope standard deviations are
averaged if the corresponding mean values exist (sample means are required to calculate overall means of standard deviations).

Currently, the following variables are considered:
\describe{
\item{Area-weighted average}{elev_mean, slope_mean, buffer, close_w, latitude, longitude, all SLC classes, lake depths, elev_std, slope_std}
\item{Volume-weighted average}{loc_tn, loc_tp}
\item{Sum}{area, rivlen, loc_vol}
}

\examples{
te <- ReadGeoData(filename = system.file("demo_model", "GeoData.txt", package = "HYPEtools"))
# Upstream stats for domain outlet
UpstreamGeoData(subid = OutletSubids(te), gd = te, olake.slc = 1, progbar = FALSE)
