\title{Extract quantiles for use in a frequency distribution plot, e.g. a flow duration curve}
\usage{
ExtractFreq(
  data,
  probs = c(0, 1e-05, 1e-04, 0.001, seq(0.01, 0.99, by = 0.01), 0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999,
    1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{either a numeric vector or an all-numeric dataframe (\code{NA}s allowed) which holds the variables for which
quantiles are computed.}

\item{probs}{numeric, vector of probabilities as in \code{\link{quantile}} with default suitable for flow duration curves.}
}
\value{
\code{ExtractFreq} returns a dataframe with probabilities in the first column, and quantiles of data in the following columns.
Number of observations per variable in \code{data} are given in an attribute \code{n.obs} (see \code{\link{attributes}}).
}
\description{
This function calculates quantiles suitable for duration curves of environmental time series data.
}
\details{
\code{ExtractFreq} is a convenience wrapper function, it uses \code{\link{quantile}} to calculate the quantiles
of one or more time series with a density appropriate for duration curves.
\code{NA}s are allowed in the input data. For the results to be meaningful, input should represent equally-spaced time series,
e.g. HYPE basin output files.
